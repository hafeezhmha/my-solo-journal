I'm not feeling strong yet, but I am taking good care of myself. The weather is perfect. I read and walk all day and then walk back to home again. Time is very different here. It is very good to be away from public ambition. "

        description: "I met Shaivali today at Cubbon. I was tired and exhausted before that. Sometimes all you need is a good conversation, some walks in nature and some kadak chai to feel like yourself again. It was a good day. We also saw some yellow-bell flowers whilst walking back to the metro station and took some awesome pictures. Cubbon park is a beautiful place and I would love to keep visiting it again and again."

As much as I adore this picture, I adore what it symbolizes and brings life to - My Curiosity. I have always been curious, so much so that I sometimes become extroverted when I am curious. I don't know If i should consider it a superpower or curse. Either way, I love it. "
